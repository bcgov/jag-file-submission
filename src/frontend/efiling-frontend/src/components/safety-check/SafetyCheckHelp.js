        <h3>Your application</h3>
        <p>
          You can review, print, or save your application by clicking on the
          document name. This will open or download a PDF version of the
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;PDF&quot; stand for Portable Document Format, which is a file
          format created by Adobe and is a standard format for printed
          documents. A PDF retains the design and layout of the document so it
          appears the same wherever it is viewed or printed.
        </p>
        <h3>Open the form in your browser</h3>
        <p>
          Your browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, or
          Safari) may have a built-in PDF viewer. If so, you can open the forms
          directly on the web.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Click on the &quot;Review and Print&quot; button to open the PDF
            form in your browser window.
          </li>
          <li>
            Depending on your browser settings, your PDF might save the form to
            your computer (see below) or it will open in a new tab or window.
          </li>
          <li>
            To print, click on the printer icon at the top of the document (it
            might be on the left or the right side).
          </li>
          <li>
            To save the file to your computer, click on the save icon (disk) or
            download icon (downward arrow) at the top of the document.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you are having trouble viewing PDFs, you may need to adjust your
          browser settings. See{" "}

        <h3>Save the forms to your computer</h3>
        <p>
          It&apos;s a great idea to save the PDF&apos;s of your forms to your
          computer so you have a backup, and can print it later. You must have
          Adobe Reader installed (or Preview on Mac), otherwise, you can{" "}

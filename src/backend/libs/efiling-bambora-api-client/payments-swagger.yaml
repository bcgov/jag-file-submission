      description: "NOTE that the full URL for this API call is https://api.na.bambora.com/scripts/tokenization/tokens. Turn a credit card into a token using this service. This helps lessen your PCI scope by not passing the credit card information to your server. Instead you turn the card number into a token in the client app, then send the token to the server. When you send the token to Bambora to make a payment, Bambora then looks up the card number from that token and makes the payment. Tokens can also be used to create payment profiles."

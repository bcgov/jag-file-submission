## Code Climate

The JAG File Submission project uses [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com) as its code quality tool. Much like SonarQube, Code Climate reads and interprets the code coverage reports generated by both the frontend and backend components of this project, and then returns a Pass/Fail status back to Github. This is an attempt to move the code quality gate in this projects development lifecycle to a point where the Maintainability and Test Coverage scores are as high as possible before this application reaches a production ready state.

The Git Action that utilizes Code Climate is run twice seperately: Once when the PR is opened(and for every push to the branch that the PR is based upon), and once on merging against master.
